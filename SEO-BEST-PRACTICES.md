# SEO Pillar Page Best Practices Template

Professional framework for creating high-quality, authentic SEO content that drives organic traffic and conversions. Adapt these guidelines to your specific industry and business.

## Core Messaging Framework

### 1. Authenticity Over Exclusivity
- **DO:** Focus on "authentic {{LOCATION}} experience," "genuine character," "rooted in sense of place"
- **DON'T:** Claim exclusivity, superiority, or "best" without specific context
- **Example:** "The authentic {{BRAND_PERSONALITY}} way - {{BRAND_PHILOSOPHY}}"

### 2. Your Brand Philosophy Approach
- Emphasize {{BRAND_PERSONALITY}} approach to {{INDUSTRY}}
- Highlight {{COMPETITIVE_ADVANTAGE_1}} vs. corporate standardization
- Reference your "{{BRAND_PHILOSOPHY_NAME}}" philosophy
- Position as embodying {{LOCATION}} character vs. just providing services

## Accuracy Requirements

### 1. Pricing
- Always use current pricing ranges
- {{PEAK_SEASON}}: {{CURRENCY}}{{PRICE_RANGE_LOW}}-{{CURRENCY}}{{PRICE_RANGE_HIGH}}
- Include seasonal variations
- Be specific about what's included vs. extra costs

### 2. Location & Logistics
- {{DISTANCE_TO_TOWN}} from downtown {{LOCATION}}
- {{WALKING_DISTANCE}} walk
- {{BOOKING_TIMELINE}}
- {{PARKING_INFORMATION}}

### 3. Services & Amenities
- **Current:** {{CURRENT_SERVICES}}
- **Removed/Seasonal:** {{SEASONAL_SERVICES}}
- Always verify operational status before mentioning

## Competitor Positioning

- {{INAPPROPRIATE_COMPETITOR_2}}
- {{INAPPROPRIATE_COMPETITOR_3}}

## Evergreen Content Best Practices

### 1. Avoid Time-Specific References
- **Don't:** "over the past two decades," "in 2025," "last year"
- **Do:** "in recent years," "historically," "traditionally"
- **Exception:** Historical context that won't change (e.g., "founded in 1970")

### 2. Present Pricing Strategically
- Always use price ranges rather than fixed prices
- Include disclaimer: "(rates subject to change)"
- Focus on value propositions rather than specific dollar amounts
- Use relative pricing: "premium pricing," "budget-friendly," "mid-range"

### 3. Generalize Temporal References
- **Don't:** "This year's calendar releases in August 2025"
- **Do:** "The calendar typically releases in August for the following year"
- Keep seasonal references (summer, winter) as they remain consistent

### 4. Future-Proof Service Mentions
- Acknowledge services may change: "when operational," "subject to availability"
- Focus on types of amenities rather than specific vendor names when possible
- Include general categories alongside specific current offerings

### 5. Use Timeless Language
- Write in present tense for current features
- Avoid trending phrases or slang that may date content
- Focus on enduring qualities rather than temporary situations

### 6. Update Strategies
- Design content for easy updates (tables for pricing, lists for services)
- Create modular sections that can be refreshed independently
- Plan for quarterly reviews of time-sensitive information

### Content Gap Opportunities

Based on existing pages, consider pillar pages for:
1. **Storm Watching Guide** (leverage cabin/suite pages)
2. **Family Vacation Planning** (tie to family amenities, calm waters)
3. **Romantic Getaways** (leverage suites, hot tubs content)
4. **Group & Event Guide** (expand on groups/weddings pages)
5. **Seasonal Activity Guide** (complement adventures page)
6. **Sustainable Tourism** (build on eco-conscious content)

### Linking Strategy for New Pillar Pages

1. **From Pillar to Existing Pages:**
   - Link to specific {{SERVICE_TYPE}} types when discussing options
   - Reference {{AMENITIES_TYPE}} page for facility details
   - Point to {{DIRECTIONS_SLUG}} for logistics
   - Include {{PHILOSOPHY_SLUG}} for philosophy mentions

2. **From Existing Pages to New Pillars:**
   - Update {{SERVICE_TYPE}} pages to reference relevant pillar content
   - Add "Learn More" sections on blog posts
   - Include pillar links in {{AMENITIES_TYPE}} descriptions
   - Cross-reference from {{GROUPS_SLUG}}/{{EVENT_TYPE}} pages

3. **Cross-Pillar Linking:**
   - Create topic clusters around themes ({{TARGET_AUDIENCE_1}}, {{TARGET_AUDIENCE_2}}, {{ACTIVITY_TYPE}})
   - Link between seasonal content
   - Connect {{SERVICE_TYPE}}-focused and {{ACTIVITY_TYPE}}-focused content
