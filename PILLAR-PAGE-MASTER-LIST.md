## Content Strategy Notes

### Competitive Positioning
- Each pillar page should position {{CLIENT_NAME}} authentically within each category
- Avoid claiming to be "the best" without context
- Focus on unique differentiators and authentic character
- Compare appropriately with similar-tier properties

### Internal Linking Strategy
- Link between related pillar pages (family ‚Üí beachfront, romantic ‚Üí luxury)
- Connect to existing blog content and accommodation pages
- Build topic clusters around accommodation types and guest types

### Evergreen Considerations
- Use price ranges with "subject to change" disclaimers
- Focus on enduring qualities rather than temporary features
- Plan for seasonal updates while maintaining core messaging
- Design for easy updates to services and amenities

### SEO Targeting
- Each pillar targets specific keyword clusters
- Long-tail keywords for conversion intent
- Local SEO elements ({{LOCATION}}, {{REGION}}, {{BROADER_GEOGRAPHIC_AREA}})
- Semantic keyword integration for topical authority
