# Client Feedback and Corrections Template - {{CLIENT_NAME}} SEO Project

**Version:** 1.0 - Template for feedback compilation and strategic corrections

## Critical Feedback Framework

### Factually Inaccurate Claims to Avoid:
- ❌ "{{CLIENT_NAME}} is the only {{BUSINESS_TYPE}}"
- ❌ "All {{SERVICE_TYPE_1}} has {{CLAIMED_EXCLUSIVE_FEATURE}}"
- ❌ "{{LOCATION}} is a private/exclusive {{LOCATION_TYPE}}"
- ❌ {{INDUSTRY_SPECIFIC_CLAIM_TO_AVOID}}

### Impact Assessment:
Review claims that are integral to current messaging but could be viewed as misleading. When corrected to be factually accurate, consider how to maintain differentiation from competitors while staying truthful.

## Recommended Strategic Positioning

### Focus on Authenticity Over Exclusivity:
The true strength lies in offering {{CUSTOMER_BENEFIT_1}} that feels **genuine, {{BRAND_PERSONALITY}}, and rooted in {{LOCATION}} character** - the "{{BRAND_PHILOSOPHY_NAME}}" way.

### Key Differentiator:
**{{COMPETITIVE_ADVANTAGE_1}} vs. {{COMPETITIVE_DISADVANTAGE_OF_OTHERS}}**

### Messaging Opportunities:
- {{AUTHENTIC_DIFFERENTIATOR_1}}
- {{AUTHENTIC_DIFFERENTIATOR_2}}
- {{AUTHENTIC_DIFFERENTIATOR_3}}
- {{BRAND_PHILOSOPHY}} approach to {{INDUSTRY}}
- Contrast with {{COMPETITOR_TYPE}} competitors

## Updated Competitive Comparison Framework

|---------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **{{COMPARISON_CATEGORY_1}}** | {{CLIENT_ADVANTAGE_1}} | {{COMPETITOR_1_APPROACH}} | {{COMPETITOR_2_APPROACH}} | {{COMPETITOR_3_APPROACH}} |
| **{{COMPARISON_CATEGORY_2}}** | {{CLIENT_ADVANTAGE_2}} | {{COMPETITOR_1_FEATURE}} | {{COMPETITOR_2_FEATURE}} | {{COMPETITOR_3_FEATURE}} |
| **{{COMPARISON_CATEGORY_3}}** | {{CLIENT_ADVANTAGE_3}} | {{COMPETITOR_1_LIMITATION}} | {{COMPETITOR_2_LIMITATION}} | {{COMPETITOR_3_LIMITATION}} |
| **{{COMPARISON_CATEGORY_4}}** | {{CLIENT_UNIQUE_FEATURE}} | {{COMPETITOR_1_STANDARD}} | {{COMPETITOR_2_STANDARD}} | {{COMPETITOR_3_STANDARD}} |
| **{{COMPARISON_CATEGORY_5}}** | {{CLIENT_PRICING_APPROACH}} | {{COMPETITOR_1_PRICING}} | {{COMPETITOR_2_PRICING}} | {{COMPETITOR_3_PRICING}} |
