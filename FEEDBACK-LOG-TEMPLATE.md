## Common Patterns Across All Feedback

### Must Avoid:
- ❌ Unverifiable superlatives ("best", "only", "most") without proof
- ❌ Exclusive access claims that can't be substantiated
- ❌ Fixed pricing without disclaimers or current verification
- ❌ Outdated service/amenity mentions
- ❌ Positioning {{CLIENT_NAME}} in inappropriate competitive categories
- ❌ Using broad category labels that invite unfavorable comparisons
- ❌ {{INDUSTRY_SPECIFIC_AVOID_1}}
- ❌ {{INDUSTRY_SPECIFIC_AVOID_2}}

### Must Include:
- ✅ Authentic {{BRAND_PERSONALITY}} positioning
- ✅ Factual, verifiable claims about {{CLIENT_NAME}}
- ✅ Price ranges with flexibility disclaimers
- ✅ Current operational status of services
- ✅ Specific {{KEY_FEATURE_1}}, {{KEY_FEATURE_2}}, {{KEY_FEATURE_3}} that differentiate
- ✅ Customer behavior insights (what actually drives {{CONVERSION_GOAL}})
- ✅ {{INDUSTRY_SPECIFIC_INCLUDE_1}}
- ✅ {{INDUSTRY_SPECIFIC_INCLUDE_2}}

### Tone Guidelines:
- {{BRAND_VOICE}} but not hyperbolic
- Honest about both pros and cons
- {{LOCAL_EXPERT_PERSPECTIVE}} insider perspective
- Focus on experience over features
