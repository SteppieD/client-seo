# Content Accuracy Checklist - SEO Project Template

## Pre-Publishing Checklist for All SEO Content

### 1. Factual Accuracy Review
- [ ] **Remove exclusivity claims** - No "only", "best", "highest-rated" unless verifiable
- [ ] **Verify beachfront access** - Clarify exact beach proximity and access type
- [ ] **Check competitor details** - Ensure all competitor information is current and accurate
- [ ] **Update pricing** - Use actual seasonal rates (Summer rates typically $400-600+)
- [ ] **Confirm amenities** - Match exact offerings (e.g., "Basic WiFi" vs "High-speed internet")

### 2. Language and Tone Adjustments
- [ ] **Replace hyperbolic language** with specific facts
  - ❌ "luxury lodges to vintage Airstreams" 
  - ✅ "rustic cabins to vintage Airstreams"
- [ ] **Remove subjective descriptors** without evidence
  - ❌ "highest rated"
  - ✅ "highly rated" or cite specific ratings
- [ ] **Avoid "too alluring" descriptions** - Keep professional and factual

### 3. Competitive Positioning Guidelines
- [ ] **Fair competitor representation** - Acknowledge shared beach access
- [ ] **Focus on authentic differentiators**:
  - Character accommodations vs. corporate standards
  - "Tofician" hospitality vs. chain hotel approach
  - Variety of accommodation types
  - Unique features (vintage Airstreams, hot tubs)
- [ ] **Avoid misleading comparisons** - All MacKenzie Beach resorts have similar beach access

### 4. Specific Content Elements
- [ ] **Location descriptions** - {{LOCATION_FEATURE_1}} is {{ACTUAL_CHARACTERISTIC}}, not {{EXAGGERATED_CLAIM}}
- [ ] **Activity accuracy** - {{LOCATION}} {{ACTIVITY_LIMITATION}} (verify actual conditions)
- [ ] **Regulation compliance** - Verify local regulations and permissions
- [ ] **Distance claims** - Verify all "X minutes to {{DESTINATION}}" statements  
- [ ] **Feature specifics** - e.g., "convenient {{FEATURE}} access" not "direct {{FEATURE}} access" unless verified

### 5. Strategic Messaging Focus
- [ ] **Authenticity over exclusivity** - Genuine, relaxed hospitality
- [ ] **Character over luxury** - Unique accommodations vs. cookie-cutter
- [ ] **Experience over location** - What makes the stay special beyond beach proximity
- [ ] **Value over price** - Focus on what's included and experience quality

### 6. Required Verifications
- [ ] **Current pricing** for all mentioned {{BUSINESS_TYPE}}s

- [ ] **Distance/time to {{ATTRACTIONS}}** and other {{LOCATIONS}}
- [ ] **Business operational status** - Verify all mentioned businesses are currently open

### 7. Competitor Information Accuracy
When mentioning other {{BUSINESS_TYPE}}s:
- [ ] {{COMPETITOR_1}} - {{ACCURATE_COMPETITOR_1_DESCRIPTION}}
- [ ] {{COMPETITOR_2}} - {{ACCURATE_COMPETITOR_2_DESCRIPTION}}
- [ ] {{COMPETITOR_3}} - {{ACCURATE_COMPETITOR_3_DESCRIPTION}}
- [ ] Always use appropriate competitors for comparison context
- [ ] Verify specific {{AMENITY_TYPES}} for each competitor before making comparisons

- [ ] ❌ {{CLOSED_BUSINESS_2}} - {{CLOSURE_STATUS}}
- [ ] Always verify operational status before mentioning any business
- [ ] Keep this list current with local business changes

### 9. Final Review Questions
- [ ] Would a competitor find any claims misleading or unfair?
- [ ] Can every claim be backed up with evidence?
- [ ] Does the content focus on genuine differentiators?
- [ ] Is pricing realistic for the season described?
- [ ] Are all superlatives ("best", "only", "most") removed or justified?
