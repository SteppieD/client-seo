**PLEASE EXECUTE THIS COMPLETE WORKFLOW:**

2. Confirm the detected niche: "I've detected your niche as [NICHE]. Is this correct?"
3. Set the {NICHE} variable for use throughout all content

## STEP 2: DEEP COMPETITOR ANALYSIS
For each competitor URL provided:
1. **Content Structure Analysis:**
   - Analyze article structure, headings, word count
   - Document content flow and organization
   - Note use of tables, lists, images, sections

2. **Language & Tone Analysis:**
   - Writing style (formal/casual, technical/accessible)
   - Brand voice and personality
   - How they position themselves vs competitors

3. **Content Types & Elements:**

   - Social proof elements (testimonials, reviews, case studies)
   - Call-to-action placement and language

4. **Link Analysis:**

   - Anchor text strategies
   - Link placement and context

5. **SEO & Technical Elements:**

## STEP 3: NICHE RESEARCH
Conduct original research on the {NICHE} industry:

2. Common customer pain points and needs
3. Typical competitive landscape
4. Content formats that perform well in this niche
5. SEO opportunities and keyword patterns

## STEP 4: CREATE COMPLETE FILE STRUCTURE
First, create a `/generated` folder to organize all customized files. Use the templates from the `/resources` folder as reference for structure and formatting. Then create these .md files customized with my variables inside the `/generated` folder:

### Core Framework Files:
- **README.md** - Project overview and quick start guide
- **business-profile.md** - Complete {BUSINESS_NAME} information and positioning
- **competitor-analysis.md** - Detailed analysis of all competitor content provided

- **content-ideas-list.md** - 20 future content topics for {BUSINESS_NAME} with suggested URLs

### Implementation Files:

- **tracking-metrics.md** - What to measure and monitor

## STEP 5: SEO URL AND META DESCRIPTION GENERATION
For each pillar page and content piece created:

1. **Generate SEO-Optimized URLs:**
   - Format: `/best-{service}-in-{location}`
   - Example: `/best-mountain-lodges-in-whistler`
   - Keep URLs under 60 characters when possible
   - Use hyphens instead of spaces
   - Include primary keyword + location

2. **Create Meta Descriptions:**
   - 150-160 characters maximum
   - Include primary keyword + location
   - Include compelling call to action
   - Format: "Discover the best {service} in {location}. {Unique value prop}. {Call to action}."
   - Example: "Discover the best mountain lodges in Whistler. Authentic alpine experiences with private hot tubs. Book your mountain getaway today!"

3. **Document in seo-urls-and-metas.md:**
   - List all generated URLs and meta descriptions
   - Include target keywords for each
   - Provide implementation instructions for CMS

## STEP 6: CUSTOMIZATION REQUIREMENTS
For every file created:
1. Replace all generic examples with {BUSINESS_NAME} specifics
2. Reference competitor insights throughout
3. Include {LOCATION}, {NICHE}, and {TARGET_CUSTOMERS} context
4. Use actual business differentiators and services
5. Create content that can compete with the analyzed competitors
6. Generate SEO-optimized URLs and meta descriptions for all content

## STEP 7: STRATEGIC POSITIONING
Based on competitor analysis:
1. Identify content gaps and opportunities
2. Position {BUSINESS_NAME} authentically vs competitors
3. Focus on specific, verifiable differentiators
4. Avoid copying - create better, more authentic content
5. Leverage {KEY_DIFFERENTIATORS} effectively

## STEP 8: FIRST PILLAR PAGE
Write a complete, publication-ready pillar page that:
1. Follows best practices learned from competitor analysis
2. Uses {BUSINESS_NAME} positioning and differentiators  
3. Targets relevant keywords for {LOCATION} + {NICHE}
4. Includes comparison tables, FAQs, and rich content
5. Can compete with or beat the analyzed competitor content

## IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Use the {VARIABLE} system consistently across all files
- Base all recommendations on actual competitor analysis, not assumptions
- Make everything specific to {NICHE} and {LOCATION}
- Focus on authentic differentiation, not false claims
- Include actionable next steps in every file
- Ensure all content is ready to implement immediately

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Present each file with clear headers like:

```
--- FILE: README.md ---
[Complete file content here]

--- FILE: business-profile.md ---

```

Please start by confirming my niche, then proceed with the complete analysis and file creation.
